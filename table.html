         Formal Definitions for Artificial IntelligenceIn their book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" Stuart Russell and PeterNorvig comment on artificial intelligence in a very comprehensive manner. Theypresent the definitions of artificial intelligence according to eight recent textbooks.These definitions can be broadly categorized under two themes. The ones in theleft column of the table below are concerned with thought process andreasoning, where as the ones in the right column address behavior.
